# unit-4-game
This is the Crystal Collector Game with a twist!

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four characters in the game to choose from.

Click upon a character and you shall add points to your total score.

To achieve victory you must match your total sum to the random number.

Shall your score reach beyond the random number, you lose Grayskull to Skeletor!

The true essence of each character may only be determined upon your desired click.

Be warned! The characters hold no permanent value! Each event leads to new possibilities!

Good luck as you attempt to save Castle Grayskull!!!
